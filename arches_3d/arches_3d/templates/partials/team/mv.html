<p>Matthew Vincent has been digging in the dirt since 2004 when he got his first taste of archaeology in Jordan. Soon
  thereafter, he began mixing another passion into archaeology: technology. Beginning with a focus on GIS in
  archaeology, he began to work on photogrammetry, laser scanning, and immersive visualization. In 2014 Matthew joined
  the Initial Training Network for Digital Cultural Heritage, a Marie Sklowdowska-Curie Actions program focused on
  holistic approaches to cultural heritage using technology. In 2015, he founded Rekri (formerly Project Mosul) with
  fellow researcher Chance Coughenour. At GDH, Matthew assists with European projects, helping to coordinate those
  while also working on continued research in crowdsourcing through Rekrei, cultural heritage data platforms related to
  GDH work in Europe, streamlining data acquisition and processing, and innovative forms of 3D data dissemination. His
  specializations include: Photogrammetry, Databases, 3D acquisition, Drones, Web-based Applications, Mobile
  Applications, Crowdsourcing, and Public Archaeology.</p>
